﻿__Jumper__ is a pathfinding library designed for __uniform-cost 2D grid-based__ games featuring [Jump Point Search][] algorithm.<br/>
It is __very__ fast, __lightweight__ and generates almost __no memory overhead while performing a search__.<br/>
As such, it might be an interesting option for __pathfinding computation on 2D maps__.<br/>
It also features a __clean public interface__ with __chaining features__ which makes it __very friendly and easy to use__.<br/>

__Jumper__ is written in pure [Lua][]. Thus, it is not __framework-related__ and can be used in __any project__ embedding [Lua][] code.

##Installation

The current repository can be retrieved locally on your computer running one of the following bash scripts:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Yonaba/Jumper.git
cd Jumper
git submodule update --init --recursive
````

Or :

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Yonaba/Jumper.git --recursive
````

##Examples of Use
Find several examples of use for __Jumper__, made with various Lua-based frameworks and game engines in this separated repository: [Jumper-Examples](https://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper-Examples)

##Usage##
###Calling Jumper###
Clone the repository in a folder named __Jumper__ inside your projet. Use *require* function to call the library.

```lua
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
```

**Note** :  You can add __.init.lua__ in your <tt>package path</tt>. As a result, requiring __Jumper__ will become easier.

```lua
package.path = package.path .. ';.\\?\\init.lua'
local Jumper = require ('Jumper')
```
	
**Note** : Some frameworks, like [Löve][] already includes  __.\init.lua__ in their <tt>package.path</tt>. In this case, just use :

```lua
local Jumper = require('Jumper')
```
###Setting your collision map
The collision map is a regular Lua table where each cell holds a value, representing whether or not the corresponding tile in the 2D world is walkable
or not.<br/>
__Caution__ : *All cells in your collision maps must be indexing with consecutive integers*.

```lua
local map = {
  {0,0,0,0,0,0},
  {0,1,2,3,4,0},
  {0,0,0,0,5,0},
  {0,1,2,3,6,0},
  {0,0,0,0,0,0},
}
```

__Note__: Lua tables starts __indexing at 1__, by default. If you happened to use some dedicated librairies/map designing tools to export your collisions maps to Lua,
the resulting tables might __start indexing at 0__. This is fairly legit in Lua, but not common, though.
__Jumper__ will accomodate such maps without any problems.

###Initializing Jumper###
Now you must now setup a 2D matrix of __integers__ or __strings__ representing your world. Values stored in this matrix
should represent whether or not a cell on the matrix is walkable or not.  If you choose for instance *0* for walkable tiles, 
__any other value__ will be considered as non walkable.

```lua
local map = {
       {0,0,0},
       {0,2,0},
       {0,0,1},
    }
```

To initialize the pathfinder, you will have to pass __five values__. 

```lua
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal,heuristicName,autoSmooth)
```

Only the first argument is __required__, the __others__ left are __optional__.
* __map__ refers to the matrix representing the 2D world.
* __walkable__ refers to the value representing walkable tiles. Will be considered as *0* if not given.
* __allowDiagonal__ is a boolean saying whether or not diagonal moves are allowed. Will be considered as __true__ if not given.
* __heuristicName__ is a predefined string constant representing the heuristic function to be used for path computation.
* __autoSmooth__ is a feature for [automatic path smoothing](https://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper/#automatic-path-smoothing).

##Distance heuristics##

*Jumper* features 3 types of distance heuristics.

* MANHATTAN Distance : <em>|dx| + |dy|</em>
* EUCLIDIAN Distance : <em>sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)</em>
* DIAGONAL Distance : <em>max(|dx|, |dy|)</em>

Each of these distance heuristics are packed inside Jumper's core. By default, when initializing  *Jumper*, __MANHATTAN__ Distance is used if 
no heuristic was specified.<br/>
If you need to use __another distance heuristic__, you will have to pass one of the following predefined strings:

```lua
"MANHATTAN" -- for MANHATTAN Distance
"EUCLIDIAN" -- for EUCLIDIAN Distance
"DIAGONAL" -- for DIAGONAL Distance
```

As an example :

```lua
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Heuristics. = require 'Jumper.core.heuristics'
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal,'EUCLIDIAN')
```

You can __alternatively__ use *setHeuristic(Name)* :

```lua
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
pather:setheuristic('EUCLIDIAN')
```

##API##

###Main Pathfinder Class API

Once loaded and initialized properly, you can now used one of the following methods listed below.<br/>
__Assuming *pather* represents an instance of *Jumper* class.__
	
####pather:setHeuristic(NAME)
Will change the heuristic to be used.<br/>
__NAME__ must be passed as a string.<br/>
Possible values are __"MANHATTAN"__,__"EUCLIDIAN"__,__"DIAGONAL"__ (case-sensitive!).
* __Argument NAME__: a string
* __Returns:__ Nothing

####pather:getHeuristic() 
Will return a reference to the __heuristic function__ internally used.<br/>
* __Argument__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ a function

####pather:setDiagonalMoves(Bool)
Argument must be a boolean. __true__ will authorize __diagonal moves__, __false__ will allow __only straight-moves__.<br/>
* __Argument Bool__: a boolean
* __Returns:__ Nothing

####pather:getDiagonalMoves()
Returns __a boolean__ saying whether or not diagonal moves are allowed.
* __Argument__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ a boolean

####pather:getGrid()
Returns a reference to the __internal grid__ used by the pathfinder.
This grid is __not__ the map matrix given on initialization, but a __virtual representation__ used internally.
* __Argument__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ a grid (regular Lua table)

####pather:getPath(startX,startY,endX,endY)
Main function, returns a path from [startX,startY] to [endX,endY] as an __ordered array__ of locations ({x = ...,y = ...}).
Otherwise returns __nil__ if there is __no valid path__.
Also returns a __second value__ representing __total cost of the move__ if a path was found.
* __Argument startX__: The X coordinate of the starting node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument startY__: The Y coordinate of the starting node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument endX__: The X coordinate of the goal node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument endY__: The Y coordinate of the goal node (positive non zero integer)

* __Returns:__ the path cost (positive number) or nil

####pather:smooth(Path)
Polishes a path
* __Argument Path__: a path (regular Lua table)
* __Returns:__ a path (regular Lua table)

####pather:setAutoSmoothing(bool)

* __Argument bool__: a boolean
* __Returns:__ Nothing

####pather:getAutoSmoothing()
Returns the status of the __AutoSmooth__ feature
* __Argument bool__: Nothing
* __Returns:__ a boolean

###Grid Class API

Using *getGrid()* returns a reference to the internal grid used by the pathfinder.
On this reference, you can use one of the following methods.<br/>
__Assuming *grid* holds the return value from *pather:getGrid()*__

####grid:getNodeAt(x,y)
Returns a reference to the node (X,Y) on the grid.

* __Argument x__: the X coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument y__: the Y coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Returns:__ a node (regular Lua table)

####grid:isWalkableAt(x,y)
Returns a boolean saying whether or not the node (X,Y) __exists on the grid and is walkable__.
* __Argument x__: the X coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument y__: the Y coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Returns:__ a boolean

####grid:setWalkableAt(x,y,boolean)
Sets the node (X,Y) __walkable or not__ depending on the boolean given.
__true__ makes the node walkable, while __false__ makes it unwalkable.
* __Argument x__: the X coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument y__: the Y coordinate of the requested node (positive non zero integer)
* __Argument boolean__: a boolean
* __Returns:__ Nothing

####grid:getNeighbours(node,allowDiagonal)
Returns an array list of nodes __neighbouring location (X,Y)__.
The list will include or not adjacent nodes regards to the boolean __allowDiagonal__.
* __Argument node__: a node (regular Lua table)
* __Argument allowDiagonal__: a boolean
* __Returns:__ list of neighbours (regular Lua table)

##Handling paths##

###Using native *getPath()* method###

Using *getPath()* will return a table representing a path from one node to another.<br/>
The path is stored in a table using the form given below:

```lua
path = {
          {x = 1,y = 1},
          {x = 2,y = 2},
          {x = 3,y = 3},
          ...
          {x = n,y = n},
        }
```

You will have to make your own use of this to __route your entities__ on the 2D map along this path.<br/>
Note that the path could contains some *holes* because of the algorithm used.<br/>
However, this should not cause a serious issue as the move from one step to another along the path is always straight.
You can accomodate of this by yourself, or use the __path smoother__.

###Using the path smoother###

__Jumper__ provides a __path smoother__ that can be used to polish a path early computed, filling the holes it may contain.
As it directly alters the path given, both of these syntax works:

```lua
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
-- Assuming map is defined
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
local path, length = pather:getPath(1,1,3,3)
-- Capturing the returned value
path = pather:smooth(path)
```

```lua  
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
-- Assuming map is defined
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
local path, length = pather:getPath(1,1,3,3)
-- Just passing the path to the smoother.
pather:smooth(path)
```

###Automatic path smoothing###
This is a new feature that will trigger the __path smoother__ everytime <tt>getPath()</tt> will be called.<br/>
Yet, it is very simple to use:

```lua  
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
-- Assuming map is defined
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
pather:setAutoSmoothing(true)
local path, length = pather:getPath(1,1,3,3)
-- No need to use path:smooth() now !
```

##Chaining##
__Jumper's__ setters can now be chained.<br/>
This is convenient if you need to __reconfigure__ the pather instance in a __quick and elegant manner__.

```lua 
local Jumper = require ('Jumper.init')
-- Assuming map is defined
local pather = Jumper(map,0)
-- some code
-- calling the pather, reconfiguring it and yielding a new path
local path,length = pather:setAutoSmoothing(true)
				   :setHeuristic('EUCLIDIAN')
				   :setDiagonalMoves(true)
				   :getPath(1,1,4,3)
-- That's it!				   
```

##Known Issues##

* __Straight moves__ : you may find paths with only straight moves allowed somewhat odd under some circumstances (too much zigzags). This is something I am aware of, and expecting to fix next.
